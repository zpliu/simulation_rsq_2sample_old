# simulation_rsq_2sample (could be removed later)
Old because  
  just as a backup purpose;  
  no reference sample;  
  not control genotypes as the same for each rsqPG    

Control rsq as YJ paper;  
Allow two sample sizes for exposure and outcome  
Output both association results and intermediate files (e.g. confounding files, genotype files, phenotype files etc)  
Compress output as gz files
