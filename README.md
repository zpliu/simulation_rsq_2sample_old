# simulation_rsq_2sample
Old because
  no reference sample;
  not control genotypes as the same for each rsqPG

Control rsq as YJ paper;  
Allow two sample sizes for exposure and outcome  
Output both association results and intermediate files (e.g. confounding files, genotype files, phenotype files etc)  
Compress output as gz files
